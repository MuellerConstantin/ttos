# TTOS - libc

This is a pretty naive implementation of a standard C library for the TTOS project.
It is intended to be used by the kernel and other parts of the operating system. This
library may not contain all standard functions and may not be fully compliant with
the C standard. It is a work in progress and will be extended as needed.
