## Introduction

Welcome to the *Tiny Toy Operating System (TTOS)* project. This project is
intended to be a simple operating system for learning purposes. It is written
for the Intel x86 architecture and originally aimed at gaining a deeper
understanding of the internal processes of an operating system as well as the
functionality of the hardware. The kernel is written in C and Assembly and
is [multiboot](https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/multiboot/multiboot.html)
compliant, which means it can be booted by the [GRUB](https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/)
bootloader.

The project itself is divided into three main parts:

- **Kernel**: The core of the operating system. It contains the source code
  for all core functionalities and default drivers of the operating system. See
  [here](kernel/README.md) for more information.
- **libc**: A naive implementation of a standard C library for the TTOS project.
  It may be replaced by an existing C library implementation/port in the future.
  See [here](libc/README.md) for more information.
- **libk**: A special library that bundles kernel-specific functions and utilities
  used by the TTOS kernel. It is an extension of the C standard library.
  See [here](libk/README.md) for more information.

## Build Instructions

The TTOS Project is intended to be built using the GNU toolchain with the GNU Compiler
Collection (GCC) and the Netwide Assembler (NASM) on a Unix-like system, but similar
configurations might also work. In addition, [GRUB](https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/)
is used to boot the operating system and create a bootable image. The build process
is automated using a GNU Make and corresponding Makefiles.

### Requirements

- **GNU Make**: The GNU Make utility is used to build the TTOS project. It is
  required to run the build process using `make`.
- **GCC**: The GNU Compiler Collection is a collection of compilers for various
  programming languages. It is the default compiler for the TTOS project.
- **NASM**: The Netwide Assembler is an assembler and disassembler for the Intel
  x86 architecture. It is used to compile the assembly code of the TTOS project.
- **GRUB**: The GNU GRUB (GRand Unified Bootloader) is a multiboot compliant
  bootloader that is used to boot the TTOS kernel. For creating a bootable image,
  GRUB command line tools, especially `grub-mkrescue`, are required.

### Build Process

As mentioned before, the build process is automated using a GNU Make and
corresponding Makefiles. Hence, building the TTOS project is as simple as
running the `make` command in the root directory of the project. The following
commands are available:

- **`make all`**: Builds the TTOS project, this includes building the kernel,
  the libc, and the libk library, and creating a bootable image. This results
  in a bootable image that is placed at `<ROOTDIR>/ttos-<VERSION>-intel-x86.iso`.
- **`make kernel`**: Builds the kernel of the TTOS project without creating a
  bootable image. This results in a kernel binary that is placed at
  `<ROOTDIR>/kernel/kernel.elf`.
- **`make clean`**: Cleans the build directory and removes all generated files.
