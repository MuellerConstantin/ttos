## Introduction

Welcome to the *Tiny Toy Operating System (TTOS)* project. This project is
intended to be a simple operating system for learning purposes. It is written
for the Intel x86 architecture and originally aimed at gaining a deeper
understanding of the internal processes of an operating system as well as the
functionality of the hardware. The kernel is written in C and Assembly and
is [multiboot](https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/multiboot/multiboot.html)
compliant, which means it can be booted by the [GRUB](https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/)
bootloader.
